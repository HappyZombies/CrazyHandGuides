	<h1>Guideline</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>This guideline is how we determine how a video gets put on our site</p>
	<h3>Montages</h3>
	<p>Montages must emphasize on combos and follow ups that users were able to perform. For example, a bad montage would be a video of someone playing Wario and just spamming side-B. Montages can be from either tournaments, against your friend, and/or For Glory. Again, please assure that the montage emphasizes on skill and not memes.</p>
	<h3>Tournaments</h3>
	<p>The highlighted character does not have to win the tournament match, they have to put up a good fight. Say you send us a video and would like Link to get highlighted. If that Link players get destroyed, it will not be displayed on our site. However, if the Link player puts up a very well fight that it was almost even, then it will be displayed here.
	<h3>Guides</h3>
	<p>Guides must cover what a character is capable of. If a guide is just telling us "His forward air is this, is down smash is this" it isn't helping anyone, we already know this. If the video says "his forward air does x% of damage, it is a good edge guarding option..." then that is a good guide and will be posted here.
