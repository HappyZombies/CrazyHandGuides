	<p>Hello everyone, I am so glad you stopped by this website.</p>
	<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, I need to add images for the DLC characters, and I also need more videos and content. I will also buy a domain for this website once it is 99% complete! If you feel like contributing, be sure to contact me on <a href="https://github.com/HappyZombies">GitHub</a> and/or <a href="https://reddit.com/u/HappyZombies">Reddit.</a></p>
	<p>If you know HTML/CSS/Javascript be sure to head over to GitHub were the files are being held and hosted. If you want certain links to be displayed then tell me !</i></p>
	<p>I need help finding appropriate videos. If you see a video of a match or a montage that you feel like should be here, please tell me so that I may add it!</p>
	<p>I do not own any of the images on this site, nor videos. Nintendo plz don't kill me :(</p>
