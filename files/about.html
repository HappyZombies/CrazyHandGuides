	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Hello everyone, I am so glad you stopped by this website.</p>
	<p>This site is intended to hold a sort of 'database' of the <i>'best'</i> videos out there for each character. Each video is 'hand picked' and considered to be a good video that displays a characters skill. If you see a video that you feel like shouldn't be here, be sure to report it!
	<p>The site is about 90% done, just need to fix some small issues and it should be completed!</p>
	<p>I still want more videos! If you see a video of a match or a montage that you feel like should be here, please send it to us!
	<p>I do not own any of the images on this site, nor videos. Nintendo plz don't kill me :(</p>
