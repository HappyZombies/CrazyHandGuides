	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Hello everyone, I am so glad you stopped by this website.</p>
	<p>This site is intended to hold a sort of 'database' of the <i>'best'</i> videos out there for each character. Each video is 'hand picked' and considered to be a good video that displays a characters skill. If you see a video that you feel like shouldn't be here, <a href = "submit.html">be sure to tell us!</a>
	<p>The site is about 90% done, just need to fix some small issues and it should be completed!</p>
	<p>If you know HTML/CSS/Javascript be sure to head over to <a href = "https://github.com/HappyZombies/smashvideocollection">GitHub</a> were the files are being held and hosted.</p>
	<p>I still want more videos! If you see a video of a match or a montage that you feel like should be here, please tell me <a href = "submit.html"><strong>here</strong></a> so that I may add it! Be sure to look over our <a href = "guideline.html">guideline</a> on how we determine a 'good' video.</p>
	<p>I do not own any of the images on this site, nor videos. Nintendo plz don't kill me :(</p>
