Hey everyone! As you can see, the site has gone through some nice changes. 

A lot of 'backend' updating has been done, so the website is now much more easier for us to configure. Thanks to the backend upgrades, we were able to add more features and fix some problems as well! Here is a list of all the changes made. 

- Removed the home button, the logo is now the home button.
- Characters now appear in alphabetical order. 
- Made the navigation menu better, more compacted.
- Fixed issue where mobile users had to click images twice to go to a new page.
- URL's are much shorter.
- Fixed logo on Firefox Browsers. Logo should be centered accordingly.
- All YouTube links now open in a new tab.
- Added category when submiting a video.
- Added a voting system! You can vote for a video now.
- Added blog page. 
- Added character icons next for tournaments. 
- Added a ton more videos. Over 200 videos of great matches and guides!


We hope you enjoy the changes and new features added. There is still much more to do in the future and I can't wait to go forward!
